# Big O

This repository contains 4 solutions to the same problem. Two of the examples are written in Javascript and two are written in Ruby.

## Problem

Given an array of numbers, check if there are any duplicates

## Exercise

Analyze the code for example_1 (either .js or .rb, whichever you prefer). What is the Big O of this algorithm? In other words, if `n` is the size of the input, how many operations will the algorithm perform in the worst case as a function of `n`?

When you are ready, repeat the exercise for example_2.
