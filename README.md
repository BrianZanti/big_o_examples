# Big O

This repository contains 4 solutions to the same problem. Two of the examples are written in Javascript and two are written in Ruby.

**The Problem**

Given an array of numbers, check if there are any duplicates

## Exercise

Analyze the code for example_1 (.js or .rb whichever you prefer). Start by running the code for different test cases and understanding the algorithm. Then, answer the Analysis Questions below.

Once you have answered all the Analysis questions for example 1, repeat the process for example 2.

## Analysis Questions

* For the input `test_case_1`, how many times does the `containsDuplicate` method use a comparison operator (`>=`, `==`, `===`, etc.)?
* Let's say the algorithm is given an input array with a million numbers. What is the *least* number of comparisons the algorithm could make between `num_1` and `num_2`? What would have to be true about that array?
* If the input array has `n` elements, what is the *most* number of comparisons the method would make as a **function** of `n`?
* Does this algorithm create any new data structures that are roughly the same size as the input array? For example another array or Hash/Object?

## THE Question

After you have completed the exercise for both examples, answer this question:

**Which algorithm is better?**
