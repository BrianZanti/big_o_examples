# Big O

This repository contains 4 solutions to the same problem. Two of the examples are written in Javascript and two are written in Ruby.

## Problem

Given an array of numbers, check if there are any duplicates

## Analysis Questions

* For the input `test_case_1`, how many times does the `containsDuplicate` method make the comparison between `num_1` and `num_2`? What about for `test_case_2`?
* Let's say the algorithm is given an input array with a million numbers. What is the *least* number of comparisons the algorithm could make between `num_1` and `num_2`? What would have to be true about that array?
* If the input array has `n` elements, what is the *most* number of comparisons the method would make as a **function** of `n`?
* Does this algorithm create any new data structures that are similar size as the input array? For example another array or Hash/Object?

## Exercise

Analyze the code for example_1 (.js or .rb whichever you prefer). Start by running the code for different test cases and understanding the algorithm. Then, answer the Analysis Questions above.

When you are ready, repeat the process for example_2.

## THE Question

After you have completed the exercise for both examples, answer this question:

**Which algorithm is better?**
